You can run `walking_test.py` to test the walking gait. In line 13 and 14 of that file, you can uncomment or comment out:

robot_server = VirtualRobotClient()
# robot_server = RealRobotClient()

to either test on real robot or virtual robot. For the virual robot, you need to run `virtual_robot_server.py` to open the virtual robot.
